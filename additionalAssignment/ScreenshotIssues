##Issues in the Screenshot
•	On SQA Travel UK but receiving prices in USD
•	Additional whitespace between “$” and “100” in “$ 100 off Dubai”
•	Deal does not match with background image. Deal for Dubai, background image is of Rio
•	Background image of Rio does not scale the whole page.
•	Tabs at the top of the page don’t align with the image width 
•	While possibly not an issue, no dates prepopulated in the calendar
•	German translations in the “STUDENT FLIGHT DEALS” sub section. Specific issue – “weitere Angebote”
•	In the same section, we are being provided both Euros and Dollar currencies. If the site is using our region, they should all be £ value.
•	U.S. Student Flights might be a fixed item on this site but again doesn’t seem useful when user is set in UK region.
•	The dropdown option selecting Student, Under 26 and Adults 27+ is limiting and doesn’t seem useful regarding travel deals. Should at least have an option for kids.
•	In the “Top Travel Deals” section, some of the sub sections have the incorrect text (potentially link is incorrect too) for the thing they are talking about.
o	“EUROPE BY TRAIN UP TO 24 COUNTRIES” and then “HOTELS” link. Should be “EURAIL”
o	“ACCOMMODATION BOOK FOR LESS” and then “EURAIL” link. Should be “HOTELS”
